In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider a scenario where you have a class 'MyClass' with a property 'data' that's a strong reference to another object:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSData *data;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ... methods ...
@end
```

If you create an instance of `MyClass` and assign data to the `data` property within a method, and then return that instance without releasing `data` in a specific scenario, it could lead to a retain cycle.  This is especially tricky if the lifecycle of the returned instance and the data object are not closely tied.  The retain cycle can lead to memory leaks, and the objects won't be deallocated until the application ends, even though they are no longer needed.
