To prevent the retain cycle, we need to break the circular reference. One solution is to use a `weak` property for `data` in `MyClass` if the `data` object's lifecycle is managed elsewhere and does not directly depend on `MyClass`:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (weak, nonatomic) NSData *data; // Changed to weak
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ... methods ...
@end
```

Alternatively, if the `data` object's lifetime is intrinsically tied to `MyClass`, consider using other patterns, such as using blocks with weak references to `self`, or manually managing reference counting (though this is less common with ARC). The most suitable solution hinges on the specific application context and the relationship between the lifecycle of `MyClass` and its `data` property.
